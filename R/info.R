#' analyzeJ2Kmodel Package
#'
#' This package is created exclusively for testing the basics details while setting up the JAMS/J2000 hydrological model (http://jams.uni-jena.de/) in a new catchment. Currently it is in the beta mode, therefore, comments and suggestions are are highly appreciated.
#'
#' Note: Currently, few considerations are to be made for running the package. Firstly, make sure to put the "workingFolder" as the "The path where the jam file is situated". For example if I put my model jam file in the following location (C:\J2K_model\j2k_koshi_modified.jam), then I will be writing workingFolder <- "C:\\J2K_model\\".
#' Based on this consideration all the calulations are made.
#'
#' Make sure to install the other packages required to run this package, by yourself. You can find the readme file in the following link:  "https://github.com/kabiraj404/analyzeJ2Kmodel/blob/master/README.md"
