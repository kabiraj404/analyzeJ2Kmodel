## Step 1: Install the devtools package
To install a R package from github, start by installing the devtools package. The best way to do this is from CRAN, by typing:  
* _install.packages("devtools")_

## Install the package from GitHub
The devtools package provides install_github() that enables installing packages from GitHub. Now the package of interest from GitHub can be installed using the author name and the name of the package.   For example in the following example we are installing analzeJ2Kmodel created kabiraj404. (in GitHub jargon, the package is the repository)

* _install_github("kabiraj404/analzeJ2Kmodel")_ #( kabiraj404 is the author and analzeJ2Kmodel is the package name )

* _library(devtools)_

* _library(analyzeJ2Kmodel)_

If you are using R.4.0 you might get the follwoing error While I was trying to install on my pc I got following error so install none. ÔÅä
